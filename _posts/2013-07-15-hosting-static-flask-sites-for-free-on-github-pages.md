This past weekend, I released [KillTheYak.com](http://killtheyak.com/), a website with guides for installing and using various tools. It's a static site powered by [Flask][] and hosted for free on [Github Pages][].

Static Flask sites are a big win because:

- They're fast.
- If you need your site to be dynamic in the future, the transition will be easy.
- There are well-developed extensions for doing this. Here I'll demonstrate [Frozen-Flask][] (for building static content) and [Flask-FlatPages][] (for writing pages in Markdown).

## App structure

[![App structure](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1693233/blog/flask-ghpages-tree.png "App structure")](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1693233/blog/flask-ghpages-tree.png)

### project/settings.py

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/6004145.js"> </script>

Key bits:

- L19: Tell Frozen-Flask to build the static content to the project root instead of the default `build/` directory. 
- L22: We also need to explicitly set `FREEZER_BASE_URL` since Github Pages hosts your repo pages on `http://username.github.com/your-reponame`. 
- L23: Don't delete all your app files!
- L26-27: Tell FlatPages to look for `.md` files in the `project/pages/` directory.

### project/app.py

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/6004129.js"> </script>

- This is where the Flask `app`, `pages`, and `freezer` instances live.

### project/views.py

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/6004206.js"> </script>

- The `page(path)` view retrieves a page object and passes it to the template.

### project/pages/bacon.md (Page example)

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/6004253.js"> </script>

- The first lines are YAML metadata. They can be accessed in views via the `page.meta` dict. For example, `page.meta['title']`. They're also accessible in the templates, as we'll see next.
- L2: Dates are parsed by PyYAML as datetime objects.

### project/templates/page.html

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/6004272.js"> </script>

### project/main.py

This just imports `app`, `pages`, and `freezer`, and `views` so that they can be accessed without circular imports ([source](https://github.com/sloria/flask-ghpages-example/blob/master/project/main.py)).

### freeze.py

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/6004277.js"> </script>

- This builds the static content to the project root.

## Deployment

After creating your Github repo, run the following:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/6004389.js"> </script>

That's it!
