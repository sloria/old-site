It was UW-Madison's spring break this past week, so I finally had some time to see family, friends, and improve my programming chops--something I desperately needed to do but haven't had nearly enough time for because of my college classes. Here are a few things I finished in the past 5 days:

- [**Reversr**](http://reversr.herokuapp.com)  [\[code\]][reversr-py] - Since I've worked primarily with full-stack web frameworks, i.e. Django and Rails, I wanted to give their micro-sized counterparts, Flask and Sinatra, a fair shot. I also needed a reason to learn the [Web Audio API][webaudio]. So I made an app with [both][reversr-py] [frameworks][reversr-rb][^1] that just records and plays back audio (in reverse, of course) in a browser.[^2]

- **Experimenting with [OpenCV][opencv] and [SimpleCV][simplecv]** - Tracking mice and recording their huddling behavior.

- **My first phylogenetic analysis** - [Tarsiers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsiers) are the cutest evolutionary mystery.


- **Online classes** - Finished about a third of [Design of Computer Programs][docp] (Udacity) and the first week of [Functional Programming in Scala][scala] (Coursera). Both Norvig and Odersky offer great introductions to functional programming.

- [**This website**](http://stevenloria.com) - Thanks to [Jekyll Bootstrap][JB] and [Github Pages][github-pages], this was amazingly simple.


[^1]: Similar in spirit to [this](http://adambard.com/blog/PHP-ruby-python-clojure-webapps-by-example/), except that my purpose was solely to teach myself rather than provide good examples of the different languages.

[^2]: I've found that one of the most efficient ways for me to start learning a new language/framework/etc. is to build a small, single-purpose app using it. I don't mean an app from a tutorial (e.g. the ubiquitous 20-minute blog) but an app that I actually find interesting. The app can be embarrassingly small and messy, as Reversr was, and I still end up **learning more in less time than it takes for to find "*the best tutorial for learning X*" on Google.**
