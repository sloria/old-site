*Edit February 28, 2014*: Removed `enumerate` usage in  "Interesting Return Value" section. Thanks Hugh Brown and Paul Winkler.

*Edit September 5, 2013*: Fixed error in Sorted Collection. Thanks Frank Sievertsen.

*Edit September 4, 2013*: Fixed typo in Choosing Message gist. `instanceof()` should be `isinstance()`. Thanks to `richardborcsik` for catching this.

*Edit July 30, 2013*: Fixed typo in Sorted Collection gist. `__lt__(self, other)` needs two arguments. Thanks to Tiago Oliveira for catching this.

These are my notes from Vladimir Keleshev's talk entitled "Python Best Practice Patterns", given on May 2, 2013 at the Python Meetup in Denmark. The original video is [here](http://youtu.be/GZNUfkVIHAY) (about 38 minutes long).

**NOTE**: Some of the code examples have been has been modified from the original presentation based on readers' feedback (see edits above).

## Composed method
    
- Divide program into methods that perform one task
    - Keep *all* operation in a method at the same level of abstraction
- Use many methods only a few lines long

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/5895669.js"> </script>

- Different levels of abstraction: bitmaps, filesystem operations, playing sounds...

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/5895673.js"> </script>

- `safety_check` deals with temp and pressure
- `alarm` deals with files and sound
- `pressure` deals with bits and converting them

## Constructor method

- provide constructors that create well-formed instances
    - Pass all required parameters to them

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/5895677.js"> </script>

- Can use class methods to make multiple constructors
    - Example: Using Cartesian or polar coordinates

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/5895679.js"> </script>

## Method objects
- How do you code a method where many lines of code share many arguments and temporary variables?

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/5895682.js"> </script>

- Can't be solved by making many small methods (would use more code)

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/5895686.js"> </script>

## Execute around method (in Python: Context manager)
- How do you represent pairs of actions that should be taken together?

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/5895687.js"> </script>

## Debug printing method
- `__str__` for users
    - e.g. `print(point)`
- `__repr__` for debugging/interactive mode

## Method comment
- small methods can be more effective than comments

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/5895694.js"> </script>

## Choosing message

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/5895717.js"> </script>

## Intention revealing message
- How do you communicate your intent when implementation is simple?
- Use for methods that do the same thing (for readability)

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/5895726.js"> </script>

## Constant method (constant class variable)

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/5895732.js"> </script>

- Depends if you are designing to make your class subclassable

## Direct and indirect variable access
- Direct
    - no need for getters and setters

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/5895737.js"> </script>

## Enumeration (iteration) method

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/5895749.js"> </script>

## Temporary variable

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/5895751.js"> </script>

## Sets
- Can often use sets instead of combination of `for` loops

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/5895758.js"> </script>

## Equality method
<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/5895762.js"> </script> 

- Probably the only case to check `isinstance()`

## Hashing method
<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/5895766.js"> </script>

## Sorted collection
<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/5895768.js"> </script>

## Concatenation
<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/5895770.js"> </script>

## Simple enumeration parameter
- When you can't come up with an iteration param that makes sense, just use `each`

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/5895773.js"> </script>

## Cascades
- Instead of writing methods without return values, make them return self
    - allows cascading of methods

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/5895776.js"> </script>

## Interesting return value

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sloria/5895782.js"> </script>

- Explicit better than implicit
- Include return value if it's interesting (even if it's `None`)
