# The name's Steve. Just Steve.

### I like science, programming, and octopuses.

I am a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, a research assistant at the [Marler Laboratory][marlerlab], a programmer at the [Waisman Center for Brain Imaging][waisman], and a life-long learner.

I'm an amateur at everything, in a constant struggle to [turn pro](/a-professional-reinvents-himself).

The easiest way to contact me is by [email][email].

You can also find me on [Github][github] and [LinkedIn][linkedin].
