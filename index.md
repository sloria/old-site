# The name's Steve. Just Steve.

### Biologist by formal education, programmer by self-education, and  octopus enthusiast.

I go to class at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, do research at the [Marler Laboratory][marlerlab], and write code at the [Waisman Center for Brain Imaging][waisman].

I'm an amateur at everything in a constant struggle to [turn pro](/a-professional-reinvents-himself).

The easiest way to contact me is by [email][email].

You can also find me on [Github][github] and [LinkedIn][linkedin]. I am no good at [Twitter][].
